## Introduction
Welcome to **Tetris Game**, a web-based version of the classic puzzle game. The goal is to stack falling blocks (known as Tetriminos) and create full rows, which will disappear and earn you points. The game speeds up over time, testing your ability to think and react quickly!

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a great learning resource for those who want to understand game development in a web environment.

## Features
- **Customizable game settings**: Choose block types and difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- **Real-time score tracking**: Keep an eye on your score as you stack blocks.
- **Responsive controls**: Use keyboard arrows to move, rotate, and drop blocks faster.
- **Next block preview**: Always see the next block that will drop.
- **Leaderboard**: High scores and player names are saved, with the top five results displayed.

## Game Rules
1. Use the arrow keys to move blocks left, right, or down.
2. Press the up arrow to rotate the blocks.
3. Complete a full horizontal row to clear it and score points.
4. As you progress, the blocks fall faster.
5. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the grid.

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Blocks fall slowly, great for beginners.
- **Medium**: Blocks fall faster, requiring quicker decisions.
- **Hard**: Blocks fall rapidly, offering a real challenge for advanced players.
